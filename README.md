## Conclusion
In our analysis we found out that:
- The “ride completion” and “ride request” stages experience almost a 50% drop-off rate each, making those funnel steps a primary target to research and improve.
- iOS seems to be the most popular platform with around 60% user engagement among the entire customer base.
- Users aged 35-44 outnumbered the others followed by age 25-34. Hence, both age groups could be made a prime target.
- Two peak periods were observed i.e between 8AM - 9AM and 4PM - 5PM. Hence, Surge pricing strategy should be applied to these two peak periods with careful consideration to balance supply and demand while maintaining positive user and driver experiences.
- The stage with the lowest conversion rate of 50.77% in the funnel is the “ride completed” stage, possibly due to long waiting time and especially highly competitive environment during the peak hours.
